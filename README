NAME
    namespace::clean::xs - Keep imports and functions out of your namespace,
    in XS

SYNOPSIS
        use namespace::clean::xs; # be lean and mean

DESCRIPTION
    See namespace::clean for complete description of this module's logic.

COMPABILITY
    All methods from namespace::clean are implemented in
    namespace::clean::xs, but individual functions have the following
    differences:

    *   get_class_store

        Structure of the returned hash is the same, but it has nothing in
        common with the internal storage. Modifications of it are in vain.

        While namespace::clean saves this info forever, this module deletes
        it after namespace cleanup is done (as it never happens for a second
        time as in the original module), so you can see valid data only for
        a short time.

    *   get_functions

        In the returned hash function stubs and constants are not expanded.
        While you can still call the latter and can't call the former, you
        may get different error messages.

    *   unimport

        Will croak on unrecognized options.

    *   import

        Will croak on unrecognized options.

        This module tries to minimize memory impact after it's usage, so it
        won't expand to full globs constant/stub functions. It also removes
        from the old package symbols without data completely.
