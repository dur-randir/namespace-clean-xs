=head1 NAME

namespace::clean::xs - Keep imports and functions out of your namespace, in XS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use namespace::clean::xs; # be lean and mean

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See L<namespace::clean> for the complete description of this module's logic.

=head1 COMPABILITY

All methods from L<namespace::clean> are implemented in L<namespace::clean::xs>, but
individual functions have the following differences:

=over

=item L</get_class_store>

Structure of the returned hash is the same, but it has nothing in common with the internal
storage. Modifications of it are in vain.

While L<namespace::clean> saves this info forever, this module deletes it after namespace
cleanup is done (as it never happens for a second time, like the original module), so you
can see valid data only for a short time.

=item L</get_functions>

In the returned hash function stubs and constants are not expanded. While you can still
call the latter and can't call the former, you may get different error messages.

=item L</unimport>

Will croak on unrecognized options.

=item L</import>

Will croak on unrecognized options.

This module tries to minimize memory impact after it's usage, so it won't expand to full globs
constant/stub functions. It also removes from the old package symbols without data completely.
